Azure Redis Cache abstracts the Redis services behind a facade and doesn't expose them directly. The simplest way to implement partitioning is to create multiple Azure Redis Cache instances and spread the data across them. You can associate each data item with an identifier (a partition key) that specifies which cache stores the data item. The client application logic can then use this identifier to route requests to the appropriate partition. This scheme is simple, but if the partitioning scheme changes (for example, if extra Azure Redis Cache instances are created), client applications may need to be reconfigured.",
