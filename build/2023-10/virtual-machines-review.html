<tr>
<td>Reduce latency</td>
<td>Consider deploying VMs in <a href="/azure/virtual-machines/co-location">Creating and using proximity placement groups using PowerShell</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Convert disks from standard HDD to premium SSD</td>
<td>Azure <a href="/azure/virtual-machines/disks-performance-tiers">premium SSDs</a> deliver high-performance and low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) with input/output (IO)-intensive workloads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Utilize Premium SSD v2 effectively</td>
<td>Premium SSD v2 allows you to granularly adjust your performance independent of the disk's size. Combining this adjustment ability with an understanding workload patterns, offers an effective cost optimization strategy for IaaS infrastructure, enabling high performance without excessive over-provisioning and minimizing the cost of unused capacity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Optimize with managed disks</td>
<td>Determine your performance needs in combination with your storage capacity needs, accounting for fluctuating workload patterns. Knowing your needs allows you to determine what disk type and disk size you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use locally attached NVMe devices</td>
<td>When available on VM SKUs, locally attached NVMe or similar devices can offer high performance, especially for use cases requiring high IOPS and low latency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consider accelerated networking</td>
<td><a href="/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-overview">Accelerated networking</a> enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use autoscaling</td>
<td>Automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances that run your application with <a href="/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/scripts/cli-sample-enable-autoscale">autoscaling</a>.</td>
