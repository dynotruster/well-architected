<td>Use fewer jobs and more tasks.</td>
<td>Using a job to run a single task is inefficient. For example, it's more efficient to use a single job containing <code>1000</code> tasks rather than creating <code>100</code> jobs that contain <code>10</code> tasks each. Running <code>1000</code> jobs, each with a single task, would be the least efficient, slowest, and most expensive approach.</td>
