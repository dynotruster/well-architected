<td>Test ExpressRoute gateway performance to meet work load requirements.</td>
<td>Use <a href="/azure/expressroute/expressroute-troubleshooting-network-performance#azurect---the-azure-connectivity-toolkit">Azure Connectivity Toolkit</a> to test performance across your ExpressRoute circuit to understand bandwidth capacity and latency of your network connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Increase the size of the ExpressRoute gateway.</td>
<td>Upgrade to a higher <a href="/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways">gateway SKU</a> for improved throughput performance between on-premises and Azure environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upgrade ExpressRoute circuit bandwidth</td>
<td>Upgrade your <a href="/azure/expressroute/about-upgrade-circuit-bandwidth">circuit bandwidth</a> to meet your work load requirements. Circuit bandwidth is shared between all virtual networks connected to the ExpressRoute circuit. Depending on your work load, one or more virtual networks can use up all the bandwidth on the circuit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enable ExpressRoute FastPath for higher throughput</td>
<td>If you're using an Ultra performance or an ErGW3AZ virtual network gateway, you can enable <a href="/azure/expressroute/about-fastpath">FastPath</a> to improve the data path performance between your on-premises network and Azure virtual network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monitor ExpressRoute circuit and gateway metrics</td>
<td>Set up alerts base on <a href="/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute">ExpressRoute metrics</a> to proactively notify you when a certain threshold is met. These metrics are useful to understand anomalies that can happen with your ExpressRoute connection such as outages and maintenance happening to your ExpressRoute circuits.</td>
